## Inspiring Figures âœ¨

Have you ever met up with someone for the first time, you get talking, and you listen to their story and part feeling so refreshed, inspired and motivated? In 2017, I felt like this a lot when I met new people. Without fail, their lively energy would pass on to me. It was so always refreshing!

I wanted to start sharing these inspiring figures on my blog for you to get to know them a bit more and any exciting projects they are doing.
